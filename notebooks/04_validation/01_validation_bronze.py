# MAGIC # Validation: bronze checks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Runs our checks on every bronze table and adds the results to `04-validation`.`dq_results`, with the same columns as Week 9: `column`, `data_quality_check`, `failed_rows`, `total_rows`, `percentage` and `status`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **stop**: the data is broken. Fix the load before anyone uses the table. A failed stop check makes this notebook fail.
# MAGIC - **flag**: the data is usable, but silver has to handle these rows. The percentage tells us how big the problem is.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each check is one SQL line in the list below. To add a check, add a line. Tables that are not loaded yet are skipped.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Most checks count rows. The checks that add up counts are different: `failed_rows` is how far off the total is (places or people), and `total_rows` is the total we expect. So the percentage still means how far off we are.
