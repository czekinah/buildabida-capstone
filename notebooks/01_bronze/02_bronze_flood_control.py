# MAGIC # Bronze: flood control projects
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Loads the DPWH flood control map layer (the data behind sumbongsapangulo.ph) into `01-bronze`.`flood_control_projects`. One row is one row of the layer. The key is `contract_id`, but a few contracts have more than one row.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Saves each call as it came in the landing volume, under today's date.
# MAGIC 2. Reads the rows with Spark and gives the columns our names.
# MAGIC 3. Adds a row to `01-bronze`.`load_log` with the total the layer reports.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It takes about 1 minute. It is safe to run twice.

# COMMAND ----------

import sys

sys.path.append("../..")  # the repo root, so the import below works everywhere

from src import api, bronze

# COMMAND ----------

# 1. Save every call as it came. About 10 calls of 1,000 rows.
folder = bronze.landing_folder("flood_control", bronze.today())
for page, rows, reported in api.flood_pages():
    bronze.write_json_lines(f"{folder}/page_{page:03d}.json", rows)
print(f"Saved {page} calls to {folder}. The layer reports {reported:,} rows.")

# COMMAND ----------

# 2. Read the rows and name the columns. The layer keeps dates as milliseconds, so we turn them into dates.
