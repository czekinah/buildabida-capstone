# MAGIC # Bronze: 2024 census, Table B
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Loads PSA's 2024 census Table B into `01-bronze`.`census_2024_table_b`. It has the population of every region, province, city and town in 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2024, plus the growth rates. One row is one row of the table, in the order PSA wrote it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The 2024 count for every place, with its PSGC code, is in `01-bronze`.`population_2024`. This table adds the older counts and the growth rates, so we can see which places grow fast.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC PSA blocks Databricks, so download the file by hand first:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Go to https://psa.gov.ph/content/2024-census-population-popcen-population-counts-declared-official-president and download **Table B - Population and PGR by Region, Province/HUC, and City/Municipality**.
# MAGIC 2. Upload it to the `psa` folder in `buildabida-capstone` > `00-source` > `landing`, next to the PSGC file.
# MAGIC 3. Write the download date in the census source card.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC How PSA lays out each region sheet: the first row is the region. A blank row starts each province, then its cities and towns follow. `block` counts these groups, and `is_block_head` marks the first row of each one. Silver uses them to tell provinces from towns.
