# MAGIC # Run everything
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Runs the notebooks in order: setup, the five bronze loads, then the checks. Click **Run all**. It takes about 15 minutes.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Put the two PSA files in the landing volume first (the steps are at the top of `03_bronze_psgc` and `04_bronze_census_2024`). If they are not there yet, those two loads are skipped and the rest still run.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC When it is done, open `05_explore/01_explore_first_look` and click **Run all** to see what the data says.
